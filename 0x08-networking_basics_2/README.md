# Networking Basics 1
## What is Local host
 localhost is a hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it. The name localhost is reserved for loopback purposes
  It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. 
## What is 127.0.0.1
 The address 127.0.0.1 is the standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic; the rest are not supported by all operating systems
## What is 0.0.0.0
 A host may use 0.0.0.0 as its own source address in IP when it has not yet been assigned an address, such as when sending the initial DHCPDISCOVER packet when using DHCP.
## What is a Host file
 The hosts file is a plain text file that all operating systems use to translate hostnames (also known as web addresses or URLs) into IP addresses.
